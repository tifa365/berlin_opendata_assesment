# Project Context and Prerequisites

## Background
This project implements a systematic approach to metadata quality assessment for Open Data portals, focusing on the Berlin Open Data Portal.

## Key Prerequisites and Context

### MQA Methodology
- The implementation is based on the Metadata Quality Assessment (MQA) methodology from data.europa.eu
- Specifically adapted from the Swiss opendata.swiss implementation
- Since the Swiss source code is not available as open source, this implementation was recreated based on their detailed methodology documentation

### Technical Adaptation
- The scoring system has been specifically adapted for Germany's DCAT-AP.de metadata structure
- The code can be used for German data portals with minor adjustments
- The implementation aims to mirror the Swiss methodology while being compatible with German metadata standards

### Limitations
- This is an approximation of the Swiss implementation, not an exact replica
- Without comparative data from other German portals, the scores provide only rough orientation values
- The goal is not competition between portals but rather helping data providers improve their metadata quality

### Future Vision
- A web dashboard similar to the Swiss implementation could make results more accessible
- Data providers could have individual logins for detailed optimization insights
- The systematic assessment helps improve the findability and usability of open data
